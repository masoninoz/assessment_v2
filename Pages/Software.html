                Software is the series of instructions that cause a computer to run. Software directs
                the actions of the computer's hardware and it's processes. Software is constantly being run
                on computers and are what the user interacts with and uses computers for. Hardware sets up the
                stage for the software to be able to run efficiently.

                        Operating systems are used to communicate between physical devices and software programs
                        and it also allows the computer to connect and communicate with external devices. As well as this,
                        operating systems act as an interface between the user and the hardware.
