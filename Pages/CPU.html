                The CPU is the main processor inside of a computer,
                it’s used to perform basic calculations to modify data.
                This modification of data is the basis of all actions in a computer,
                anything from writing text to calculating numbers or drawing images.
                They can all be performed and modified from changing numbers. The CPU is
                generally considered to be the brain of a computer, and controls most of the
                operations inside of a computer. There are three main segments of a CPU that
                each perform different functions.
            </p>

            <p class="space1"></p>

            <h2 id="ALU">Arithmetic-Logic Unit</h2>
            <p>
                The arithmetic-logic unit performs basic arithmetic operations
                on data taken from storage or input devices and can also compare
                numbers and inputs to make decisions depending on the outcomes of
                those comparisons. The ALU is given code, called operation code, from
                the control unit of the CPU to provide the numbers to perform an operation
                on and also what operation to perform on that data. The ALU can directly access
                primary storage, such as RAM to retrieve or modify data stored on those devices.
            </p>

            <p class="space1"></p>

            <h2 id="CU">Control Unit</h2>
            <p>
                The control unit coordinates inputs, outputs and data storage to and
                from the CPU as well as organising the function of the CPU. The control
                unit is responsible for causing the CPU to step through each instruction
                of a program in time with the system clock with the clock acting as a
                method of synchronising all the actions.

                        The control unit takes instructions,
                        stored inside the instruction register and causes the ALU to execute those
                        instructions, then exports those outputs through data buses, which are a
                        name for the paths for data transfer.

            <h2 id="Register">Registers</h2>
            <p>
                There are many different registers within the CPU,
                used to hold small bits of data for different purposes.
                Standardly, a register has the same number of bits as the
                computer, for example, a 64x bit computer will have a 64x bit
                register but this isn’t always the case. There are many different
                types of registers, on register is the index register. The CPU
                has several index registers which are used to store addresses
                of data so that they can send information and receive data from
                those addresses. Another type of register is the accumulator,
                which is used to store the most recent calculation from a CPU,
            </p>

                        another is the storage register which stores data to and from
                        primary storage to be access by the CPU during it’s calculations
                        and there is also the instruction register which holds the operations
                        that need to be performed by the CPU. There are many other registers
                        but these are the primary ones used by the CPU. In the diagram, the green boxes
                        represent the various registers used inside the CPU.
