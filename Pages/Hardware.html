                Hardware is the physical devices that make up the computer, they hold the contents for the software
                to run. All data, calculations and programs are held, transfered and run on hardware. Put simply, hardware
                consists of the physical devices assosiated with the functioning of a computer.

            <p>
                An input device is a physical device used to input data into the computer
                to be processed into meaningful information that can be used in programs
                to modify outputs. Input devices are a fundamental aspect of any computer
                as it allows the user to interact with and control the function of a computer.
                Without input devices, there would be no way to control the computers processes.

                        Some key examples of input devices that almost all personal computers have include
                        mice, keyboards, microphones and any other device that is used by the user to give data to the computer.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                Processors are hardware devices that compute data and turn it into information, this is done by following a set
                series of instructions, designated by a program. The main processor of a computer, the Central Processing Unit (CPU)
                takes in input data and performs calcuations on that data before outputting the processed information to an output device.
                Another kind of processor is the graphics card that performs calculations to create and calcuate complex situations
                and graphics.
            </p>
            <p> See CPU page for more information on the main processor of a computer.</p>

            <p>
                Output devices are the exact opposite of input devices,
                they are a peripheral device, devices not directly connected to a motherboard, used to present information
                to the user, often the result of calculations from the computer
                or the product of inputs given by the user.

                        The control unit takes instructions,
                        stored inside the instruction register and causes the ALU to execute those
                        instructions, then exports those outputs through data buses, which are a
                        name for the paths for data transfer.

            <h2 id="Storage">Storage</h2>
            <p>
                There are two main types of storage, primary and secondary storage.
                Storage are physical devices that store data and information for the
                computer to access. This can be anything from a program to a number.
            </p>
            <p>
                Primary storage is storage that can be directly accessed by the CPU
                and stores data before and after it has been processed. Primary storage
                can but doesn’t normally hold permanent information but instead that
                information is transferred to secondary storage. An example of primary
                storage is RAM, which is a volatile storage, meaning that when the RAM
                doesn’t get any more energy, the data is lost. RAM can be directly accessed
                by the CPU and is used to speed up the retrieval of data from the hard drive
                by keeping it closer and quicker to access.
            </p>
            <p>
                Secondary storage are external devices that normally hold long term data and information.
                They often store programs or permanently modified data such as a saved file. They do
                not erase their data when the power is turned off, called non-volatile storage.
                The hard drive is a common example of secondary storage. The hard drive stores all
                of the programs and most of the permanent files.
